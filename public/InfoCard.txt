# INSTRUCTIONS 
 ~ please do not edit section titles TEXT:, IMAGE:, or VIDEO: you just need to add your info after it. 
 ~ The card can contain text up to 160 characters, an image, OR a video. If you want to combine two 
   of these options it will take some adjusting to make sure it all fits correctly so just let us know if that is the case
   and we can find what works for the display. 
  

# TEXT HOW TO: Try to keep it under 300 characters. Otherwise we loose visiblity of both graphs. This shows in a small info card.
